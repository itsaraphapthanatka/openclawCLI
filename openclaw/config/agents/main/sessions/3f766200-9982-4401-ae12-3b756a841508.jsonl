The current date isn't explicitly stated, but I can infer from the session info or just proceed with reading the required files.\n\nActually, looking at the system prompt, it says \"Current Date & Time: Time zone: UTC\" but doesn't give the actual date. Let me just proceed with reading the files. I'll read SOUL.md, USER.md, and check for memory files.\n\nSince I don't have the exact date, I'll try to read memory files for today and yesterday. But first let me read SOUL.md and USER.md which I already have in the context (they were injected in Project Context). \n\nLooking at the Project Context:\n- SOUL.md says: Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Skip the \"Great question!\" and \"I'd be happy to help!\" — just help.\n- USER.md is mostly empty - needs to be filled in\n- BOOTSTRAP.md exists and says this is a fresh workspace\n\nSince BOOTSTRAP.md exists, the instructions say \"If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it.\"\n\nSo this appears to be a first-run scenario.
